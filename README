Demo on how to sue IronWorker to compute the MD5 of a file.

The dockerworker/ directory contains the "worker" code, in the shape
of a Dockerfile.

The Docker image is created and made public on dockerhub:

```
 $ docker build -t gario/irondemo .
 $ docker push gario/irondemo
```

We then configure IronWorker. We created a project on IronWorker and
downloaded the iron.json credentials. We create the worker (new_demo)
using the docker image (ironcli_linux is the tool from IronWorker repo)

```
 $ ./ironcli_linux worker upload --name new_demo gario/irondemo
```

This solves the "server" side. For the client we need to pip install the dependencies:
```
 $ pip install --user iron-worker
```
